## OOCSS (Object Oriented Cascading Style Sheets)
The purpose of **OOCSS** is to encourage code reuse, ultimately, faster and more efficient stylesheets that are easier to add and maintain. It works based in two main principles, such as

- Separation of Structure from Skin (Group common styles and add class for them to reuse).
- Separation of Cotainers from Content ().
