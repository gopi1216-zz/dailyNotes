## Points to remember as Developer
- Study like Tortoise.
- Study a chapter/topic for 5 or 10 minutes
- Practice the same chapter/topic for 20 to 30 minutes.
- Take rest for 20 minutes.

## Alerts :
- Description: alert is just a box that pops up to give the user a message. Syntax for the alert is mentioned below. Few developers use **window.alert()** and few are good with short method **alert()**.
- Syntax: 
```js
alert('Welcome to JavaScript..!');
```

## Variables :
- Variable is just container holding some value with name. 
- **'var'** is used to create a variable followed by variable name like below example.
```js
var fullName = 'Gopi Jagarlamudi';
```
- Whenever the JS encounters **fullName**, JS knows that it's a variable refers to ***Gopi Jagarlamudi***.
- We can also change variables to new value like below
```js
fullName = 'JavaScript Developer';
```
- Now the **fullName** variavle refers to new value ***JavaScript Developer***.
